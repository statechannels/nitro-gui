# Nitro RPC Client

The nitro RPC client is a typescript client that can make RPC calls against a go-nitro RPC server.

## Using the RPC Client

```typescript
import { NitroRpcClient } from "./rpc-client";

const rpcPort = 4222;

const rpcClient = await NitroRpcClient.CreateNatsRpcClient(
  `127.0.0.1:${rpcPort}`
);

const counterParty = `0xDEADBEEF`;

const paymentChannelInfo = await rpcClient.DirectFund(counterParty);

console.log(
  `Created channel ${paymentChannelInfo.ChannelId} with counterparty ${counterParty}`
);

await rpcClient.Close();
```
